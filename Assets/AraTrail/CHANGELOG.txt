# Change Log
All notable changes to “Ara Trails” will be documented in this file.

## [1.4] - 2019-12-19
### Added
- Support for LWRP
- Quad mapping: This eliminates UV distortion when using the default triangle-strip trails. It relies on the shader accepting 4-component texture coordinates, and using tex2Dproj instead of tex2D.

### Fixed 
- Bug with incorrect tangent-space calculation when using explicit point orientation.

## [1.3] - 2019-01-31
### Added 
- Custom trail sections: trails can now take as input any shape to extrude along the trail's path.

## [1.2] - 2018-12-14
### Fixed 
- Bug that caused all cameras present in the scene to update the trail regardless of their layer culling mask.

## [1.1] - 2018-3-31
### Added 
- Sorting option: allows to alternate between two drawing orders: newer on top, or older on top (default).
### Fixed 
- Bug that caused UV coords for the first trail segment to be incorrect.

## [1.0.2] - 2018-3-31
### Added 
- Timescale option: allows to use unscaled time instead of regular delta time.
### Fixed 
- Bug that prevented passing float.PositiveInfinity as the points lifetime.


## [1.0.1] - 2018-3-06
### Fixed 
- Bug that caused the corner roundess feature to generate incorrect texture coordinates in certain cases.

### Added
- Warmup time for physical simulation of trails.

### Changed
- Order of inspector sections is now Overall > Lenght > Time > Emission > Phisics > Texture > Rendering.


## [1.0.0] - 2017-10-16
- Initial release.
